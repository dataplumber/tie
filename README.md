# The Imagery Exchange (TIE)
The Imagery Exchange (TIE) provides imagery ingestion, management, and generation automation solution.  It is deployed as part of the NASA's Global Imagery Browse Services system.  TIE extends the Horizon framework to leverage its horizontal scaling architecture and automation capabilities.  It specializes on
* Data/Imagery Artifacts – Imagery Handlers are designed to ingestion and process artifacts in JPEG, PNG, or GeoTIFF file formats.
* Inventory Data Model - Imagery product artifact focused with attributes for visual representation as well as for product generation. The Imagery inventory catalogs Product Types and Product artifacts with provenance to the source Datasets and Granules.
* Ingest Lifecycle – A key part of TIE is to facilitate automatic transformation of high resolution imageries into imagery tiles for high performance distribution and visualization.  A specilzed workflow is integrated to automate generation and distirbution of imagery tiles.
