The following instructions are for the deployment of the
HORIZON weekly reporting web tool.  The code and other build
files can be found in the following directories:
/<repository_base_path>/report/trunk/
/<repository_base_path>/report/trunk/src
/<repository_base_path>/report/trunk/war

$CATALINA_HOME needs to be defined properly before the
tomcat server is started.  Since the tomcat process
is usually started as the tomcat user, this means
$CATALINA_HOME needs to be defined in the shell that
the tomcat user uses.

These files need to be modified to comply with the environment
which the tool will be deployed.

I. /<repository_base_path>/report/trunk/build.properties
   in which:
   appserver.home should point to the current $CATALINA_HOME
   (that is, where Tomcat is installed).

   tomcat.manager.url should point to the URL of the current
   Tomcat manager.

   tomcat.manager.username and tomcat.manager.password should
   be current.

   db.url should point to an instance of the Oracle database.

   db.user and db.pw should be current.

II. /<repository_base_path>/report/trunk/war/WEB-INF/messages.properties
   in which:
   db.url, db.user, and db.pw should be consistent with what are
   in the above build.properties file.

III. /<repository_base_path>/report/trunk/war/WEB-INF/classes/log4j.properties
   in which:
   log4j.appender.logfile.File should point to:
   $CATALINA_HOME/logs/report.log

Once the above files are modified the database table needs 
to be created and the war needs to be built.

To build database table catalog please run:
pwd = /<deployed_base_path>/report/trunk
ant createTables
Please note this only needs to be run if db table does not yet exist.
Other available test tools are available by simply typing ant in 
the above pwd.

To build the war file for deployment, cd to:
/<repository_base_path>/report/trunk/
and type:
ant deploywar
A war file report.war will be created in that directory
and will be copied to deploy.path as defined in:
/<repository_base_path>/report/trunk/build.properties
deploy.path should be the same as $CATALINA_HOME/webapps

The following instructions are for the deployment of the
HORIZON weekly report archiving tool.  This should be
deployed and run after the web tool is deployed and run.
After running ant deploywar above, which builds the class
files for the archiving tool, do the following:
On the same machine where the reporting web tool is
deployed, as the tomcat user,
cd /<repository_base_path>/report/trunk/src/util

Modify the four paths in the text file crontab as follows:
1 22 * * 4  cd /home/tomcat/work/webapps/report/trunk/src/util; 
source environment.sh; /usr/bin/ant run >> /home/tomcat/report_curl.log; 
date >> /home/tomcat/report_curl.log
(The sample crontab kicks off the archiving process
every Thursday at 23:00.)
The 1st path is /<repository_base_path>/report/trunk/src/util (i.e., where
the file crontab is)
The 2nd command -- source -- is how to get $JAVA_HOME, $CATALINA_HOME,
$PATH etc. defined.  Modify environment.sh to match your installations;
The 2nd path is where ant is (path not needed if $ANT_HOME is set).
The 3rd and 4th paths are where you want your log file to be saved.

Then start the cron job:
crontab crontab

It is assumed that curl is installed here:
/usr/bin/curl
